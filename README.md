# bits-bank-auth-service

# Purpose: Handles user authentication, authorization, and session management.

🔹 Tech Stack:

# Backend: Golang
Database: PostgreSQL (Stores user details, hashed passwords, and session data)
Cache: Redis (For session store and rate limiting)
Auth Strategy: JWT-based authentication
🔹 Key Responsibilities:
✅ User Registration & Login (Email, Password, OTP-based login)
✅ Session Management (Token storage in Redis, auto-expiry)
✅ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
✅ Secure API Gateway Authentication (Protects microservices using JWT)

🔹 Endpoints Example:

POST `/signup` → Register a new user
POST `/login` → Authenticate user & generate JWT
GET `/get-user` → Fetch logged-in user details
POST `/logout` → Clear session
🔹 External Integrations:

API Gateway → To centralize authentication for all services
Stripe & Plaid Services → Verifies if the user is authenticated before processing requests
